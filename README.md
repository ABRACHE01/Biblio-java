## Context
The municipal library of the city of Paris is facing several issues related to manual book management and the lack of an efficient tracking system.   
These problems particularly manifest in the following difficulties:  

**Inefficient management:**  Librarians have to perform all tasks related to book management manually, which can lead to errors and loss of time. Maintaining an up-to-date database and keeping track of the status of each book (available or borrowed) becomes challenging.  
**Search difficulties:**  Library users struggle to find the books they want to borrow. The absence of an efficient search system makes the process tedious and can discourage users.  
**Lack of statistics:**  There is no easy way to obtain statistics on available books, borrowed books, and lost books. This limits the library's ability to analyze and optimize its collections.   

In summary, the need is to develop a Java-based library management console application that allows for automated book management, efficient search, handling of borrowings and returns, as well as the generation of statistical reports. This application aims to address the issues of inefficient management and search difficulties faced by the library while improving the user experience.
